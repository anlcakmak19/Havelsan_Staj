This repository contains the work whichs are Gas emission estimator and Fault condition classfication , I did during my Internship. Our dataset is private so I can not publish dataset. I can only publish my codes. In brief, our dataset contain several sensor information in ship with different condition like Sea tempeture , Load type, etc.

# Gas emission estimator 
Estimating the emission of Smoke content gas with sensor data on board. We use several techniques and machine learning algorithms like Randomforest and Xgboost. Finally, we try to implement a model with a Neural network. In this project, we also work on feature extraction, model optimization, etc.

# Fault condition classfication
Our goal is to determine which malfunction state the ship is in with the sensor data we have. We use some classification machine learning algorithms like Xgboost, KNN, etc. Then we use Neural Networks with RNN, LSTM, etc. We compare the result and choose the best model. In this project, we learn some encoding techniques like one hot encoder and frequency encoder.
